Lyrics
======

Lyrics helps me make LRC file. It's based on node-webkit, jQuery and bootstrap.

### How to use Lyrics

Lyrics is __not packaged__ yet. You can use lyrics following steps below.

* install node-webkit following this [link](https://github.com/rogerwang/node-webkit/wiki/How-to-run-apps#mac-os-x)
* Check out source files
* run `nw .` in the root of the source directory

If you need a packaged program, you can do it yourself following this [tutorial](https://github.com/rogerwang/node-webkit/wiki/How-to-package-and-distribute-your-apps), it seems to be easy. And I will package it soon. 

###Todos
